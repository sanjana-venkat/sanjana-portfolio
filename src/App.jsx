const CONTENT = {
  "how do you uncover user needs": `I look beyond surface-level metrics to understand the intent behind user behavior. At JPMC, we were a small team trying to reduce drop-offs in an application flow.

Tired of not seeing drastic impact, we went deep into the data and I made a funnel visualization that revealed something simple but important:

We were missing a huge part of the market.

That one artifact:
• Secured $10K+ in investment
• Got the 3rd Home Lending business case
• Aligned leadership around the redesign

Then through exit surveys, heat maps, and extensive A/B testing, we defined a need-based segmentation strategy.`,

  "let's talk AI": `I believe good design is about getting closer to human intent, and with AI, that gap gets smaller.

What excites me most is conversational AI because voice captures uncertainty, evolving thoughts and emotional context

Better than static interfaces. 

At JPMC, I worked on AI across multiple surfaces:

• Personalization model
  drove a 17% CTR lift through dynamic content adaptation

• Casey AI
  handled 1,000+ customer conversations and acted as both a digital re-engagement strategy and lead qualifier for the business

• ChatGPT + Gemini integrations
  prototypes used by leadership to communicate future product direction

I also use AI as a thinking partner in my workflow to rapidly explore, prototype, and refine ideas.`,

  "product strategy thinking": `In bigger companies, it's hard to avoid disagreeing and going through multiple iterations, but I learnt that defining the problem early and aligning all stakeholders helps us ship fast.

At JPMC, I shaped the personalization framework by combining research, behavioral signals, and need-based segmentation. Instead of treating users as static personas, we looked at what they needed in the moment.

That thinking helped the team move from "personalized content" to personalized recommendations:
• what does this customer need right now?
• what signal tells us that?
• how should the experience respond?

That's why I am so excited to unlock more possibilities with AI as we bring in real-time personalization with more data to build accurate recommendations.`,

  "designing systems at scale": `When I first joined the team, a lot of the work was focused on reducing drop-offs. I had ideas from competitive analysis, but I kept running into important constraints:

• we do not have that data to pre-fill information
• we cannot make this fully self-service
• human advisors still need to be part of the journey

That pushed me to learn the backend and map the full Apply & Fulfillment ecosystem. I created a service design blueprint that became a living document for all stakeholders.

It helped designers think beyond "change the content" or "add bigger tiles" and start designing around:
• user confidence
• operational handoffs
• self-service moments
• backend dependencies`,

  "how do you ship fast": `I move quickly by combining systems thinking, rapid prototyping, and close engineering collaboration.

At JPMC, I analyzed edge cases for 20+ offers and built a plug-and-play offer template using atomic design principles.

In close collaboration with engineering, we launched it quickly.

The result:
• Zero additional design/dev lift for an offer page
• Accelerated marketing velocity by 3 sprints
• Scaled across multiple use cases

I also prototype with tools like Codex, Google AI Studio, Claude, and Google Stitch.

This portfolio itself was concepted, designed, and built in 2 days as an interactive pre-interview experience. Before AI tools, I was already building product ideas and prototypes in 24-hour hackathons, often as the only designer on the team.`,

  "tell me your story": `Here's how it happened.

I joined Paycom as an Associate Product Designer and threw myself into the work completely.

Not just doing my job, I became one of the founding members of a brand new subteam, helping build something from scratch while most people were still finding their footing.

Then JPMC reached out.

Turns out I had helped someone with a presentation at a conference I organized in college, and that stuck with them.

I joined as a Senior Product Designer and moved quickly into AI initiatives, marketing strategy, personalization systems, and scalable design foundations.

I learn by doing, and I do a lot :).`,

  "how do you get exec buy-in": `I learnt that empathy is not just used in design, but also with stakeholders. 

Instead of trying to convince stakeholders, I start from where they are and we walk together toward a new shared vision. 

At JPMC, we built ChatGPT + Gemini prototypes in under a week.

The output was not just a feature. It was a story that an executive leader used that work to present to senior leadership, including CEO Jamie Dimon.

When I present, I focus on:
• What the opportunity is
• Why it matters
• What decision needs to be made

Because I learned that good design doesn't work unless people understand it.`,

  "model design": `I drove work and teams towards launch and learn even in a traditionally slower environment. I was known as the "all-in-one" designer because of my deep collaboration with product, engineering, marketing, senior leadership, and yes, data science and ML teams too.

That's why I was so excited to see Model Designer as a role. I'm genuinely more interested in this than visual design, and I want to shape the UX strategy behind model classification, filtering, and response mapping.

At JPMC:
• Need-based framework, I built a behavioral segmentation model to classify user intent and map it to personalized messaging that resonates with what users actually need in that moment
• Casey AI, I shaped model responses and defined constraints for edge cases in an omni-channel conversational AI handling 1,000+ customer conversations

Personal project:
• I built Outdone because I felt personalization relies too much on historical data and forgets what someone might want today. I classified people into 9 archetypes so Gemini could sort all possible responses into these categories. I wired the APIs myself, and intentionally showed users how the AI was generating responses in the loading state, because I think AI should feel understandable, not magical.`
};

const USER_NEEDS_REST = `The first outcome wasn't perfectly clean. Overall lead submit decreased. So I went deep into the data again and found the breakthrough:

38% increase in lead initiation with clearer Apply messaging.

In a few sprints, we pushed toward redesigning the full journey and got design system modernization onto the roadmap.

Today, the experience is live and evolving with AI.`;
