  "Show data-driven design": `I led the redesign of chase.com’s home lending experience. It started with a funnel visualization I built. It showed leadership something simple but important:

We were missing a huge part of the market

That one artifact secured $10k+ in investment.

Then analyzing exit surveys, heat maps and extensive A/B testing we defined a design strategy with need-based segmentation`,

  "Tell me your story": `Here’s how it happened:

I joined Paycom as an Associate Product Designer and threw myself into the work completely. Not just doing my job, I became one of the founding members of a brand new subteam, helping build something from scratch while most people were still finding their footing.

Then out of nowhere, JPMC reached out. Turns out I had helped someone with a presentation at a conference I organized back in college, and that stuck with them. When they had an opening, they remembered.

I applied. I got the role. And they brought me in as a Senior Product Designer, a real bump, because of how I presented myself and my work.

From there, I moved fast. Required little to no guidance. Owned AI initiatives, set the foundation for the marketing design team, and built things that still run today. I learn by doing, and I do a lot.`,

  "How I think about AI systems": `i’ve shipped ai across multiple surfaces at jpmc

1. personalization model (home lending tiles)
- dynamically adapts content based on user signals
- resulted in a 17% ctr lift

2. casey ai
- ai calling agent built with bland ai
- handled 1000+ customer conversations
- answered mortgage questions and qualified leads

3. ai search integrations
- chatgpt + gemini surfaces for chase
- used by executive leadership to present future direction

for me, ai isn’t a feature

it’s about:
making systems more responsive
and reducing friction before humans step in`,

  "Design systems under constraints": `at jpmc,
i built a standardized atomic design template

it:
- reduced marketing velocity by 3 sprints
- required zero additional design or dev lift
- scaled across multiple use cases

at paycom,
i went beyond my project scope

i audited the entire component library and found:
- inconsistent spacing
- fragmented interaction states
- 40+ variants that could be simplified to 3

i proposed a full system redesign:
- 8pt spacing tokens
- shared state patterns
- prop-based components

that’s where i learned:
design systems aren’t just about consistency

they’re about making teams move faster`,

  "Product strategy thinking": `my biggest strength is framing the problem early

before anything gets designed,
i define what we’re actually solving

at jpmc,
i ran 3-day workshops with leadership

we’d go from:
“we need a redesign”

to:
- here’s the real problem
- here’s the data
- here’s the roadmap

i’ve used this approach across:
- ai personalization
- the apply flow
- public home lending

everything tied back to:
clear direction + measurable outcomes

i don’t just design solutions

i shape what gets built in the first place`,

  "How I get exec buy-in": `i design for the room, not just the screen

at jpmc,
we built chatgpt + gemini prototypes in under a week

the output wasn’t just a feature
it was a story

an executive leader used that work
to present to senior leadership

i also build market visualizations

one of them:
helped secure $10k+ in investment
for the home lending public redesign

when i present, i focus on:
- what the opportunity is
- why it matters
- what decision needs to be made

because good design doesn’t land
unless people understand it`
